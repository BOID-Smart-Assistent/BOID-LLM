Is that correct?\" If he confirms or provides additional information about other areas where he might have responsibilities (e.g., teaching specific courses), we could update our summary accordingly, but based on this data alone, Machine Learning would be listed as an area of obligation for Dr. Jan de Vries in his professional profile at Utrecht University."
