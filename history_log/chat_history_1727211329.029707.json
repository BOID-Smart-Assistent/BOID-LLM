    "content": "<start> Obligations: Machine Learning <end>\n\nAs for additional obligations, without more context or information about Dr. Jan de Vries's role at Utrecht University beyond his stated interest in machine learning and transformers as well as compilers, it is not possible to accurately determine other specific obligations he might have within the university setting. However, given that an Assistant Professor typically has teaching responsibilities along with research duties, one could infer additional general academic obligations such as:\n- Teaching courses related to his field of expertise (e.g., machine learning).\n- Supervising graduate students and their thesis work or dissertation projects.\n- Participating in departmental meetings and contributing to curriculum development.\n- Engaging with the academic community through publications, conferences, and seminars."
