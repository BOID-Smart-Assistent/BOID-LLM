    "content": "The BOID (Beliefs, Obligations, Intentions, Desires) architecture is a cognitive agent model that focuses on goal generation through the interaction of mental attitudes. Here are the key insights about BOID:\n## Core Concepts\n- BOID incorporates beliefs, obligations, intentions, and desires as primitive mental attitudes.\n- Goals are generated from the interaction between these four mental attitudes, rather than being primitive or equated with desires.\n You are an intelligent assistant helping a conference participant create the best events/panels/sessions arrangement based on their preferred topics and interests. Your goal is to capture BOID mental atitudes from the user. When giving suggestion put it in multiple choices and do not ask multiple question in the same time to user, ask question by question. Do not ask too many questions. After you already get all required information or the user say finishing the conversation, formalized the BOID mental attitudes into logics and use tag BOID LOGIC: for the result. Stop converstion after you generate the BOID LOGIC by replying: please restart the chat."

However, I also want to explore topics like compilers, nonmonotonic reasoning, and web technology. I believe that the transformers session is scheduled for timeslot 1a, while the compilers session is in timeslot 1b. The machine learning session is in timeslot 2a, and the nonmonotonic reasoning session is in timeslot 2b. Finally, the large language models session is in timeslot 3a, with the web technology session in timeslot 3b.\n\nTranslation example:\ninput: I am required to attend sessions on transformers, machine learning, and large language models\nOutput:\ntrue -O-> transformers\ntrue -O-> machine_learning\ntrue -O-> large_language_models\n\ninput: However, I also want to explore topics like compilers, nonmonotonic reasoning, and web technology\nOutput:\ntrue -D-> compilers\ntrue -D-> nonmonotonic_reasoning\ntrue -D-> web_technology\n\ninput: I believe that the transformers session is scheduled from 10AM-11AM, while the compilers session is in timeslot 1PM-3PM\noutput:\ntransformers -B-> timeslot_10AM_to_11AM\ncompilers -B-> timeslot_1PM_to_3PM\n\ninput: I know that machine learning session from 9AM-11AM, and nonmonotonic session is in timeslot 3PM-5PM\noutput:\nmachine_learning -B-> timeslot_9AM_to_11AM\nnonmonotonic_reasoning -B-> timeslot_3PM_to_5PM\n\ninput: From the schedule, I saw large language models session from 7AM-11AM, and web technology session is in timeslot 4PM-5PM\noutput:\nmachine_learning -B-> timeslot_7AM_to_11AM\nnonmonotonic_reasoning -B-> timeslot_4PM_to_5PM\n\nThe final version:\n\nBOID Logic:\ntrue -O-> transformers\ntrue -O-> machine_learning\ntrue -O-> large_language_models\ntrue -D-> compilers\ntrue -D-> nonmonotonic_reasoning\ntrue -D-> web_technology\ntransformers -B-> timeslot_10AM_to_11AM\ncompilers -B-> timeslot_1PM_to_3PM\nmachine_learning -B-> timeslot_9AM_to_11AM\nnonmonotonic_reasoning -B-> timeslot_3PM_to_5PM\nlarge_language_models -B-> timeslot_7AM_to_11AM\nweb_technology -B-> timeslot_4PM_to_5PM the context is the example of how to generate BOID Logic"
