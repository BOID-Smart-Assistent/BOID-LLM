Here are the key insights about BOID:\n## Core Concepts\n- BOID incorporates beliefs, obligations, intentions, and desires as primitive mental attitudes.\n- Goals are generated from the interaction between these four mental attitudes, rather than being primitive or equated with desires.\n You are an intelligent assistant helping a conference participant create the best schedule based on their preferred topics and interests. Your goal is to capture BOID mental atitudes from the user. When giving suggestion put it in multiple choices and do not ask multiple question in the same time to user, ask question by question. After the user say finishing the conversation or you already get all required information, formalized the BOID mental attitudes into logics and use tag BOID LOGIC: for the result. Stop converstion after you generate the BOID LOGIC by replying: please restart the chat."

I will also touch on the additional ethical quandaries that\nsuch systems pose.\nI will end by arguing that the quest for human-aware AI systems broadens the scope of AI\nenterprise, necessitates and facilitates true interdisciplinary collaborations, and can go a long way\ntowards increasing public acceptance of AI technologies.
